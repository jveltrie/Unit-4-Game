# Unit-4-Game
new assignment
I had a difficult time getting the game to run. I spent too much time making it look nice. I also was not able to get the background image to run like I wanted so I went with just a solid color. As you will see the number remains on '78' and nothing happens. :(
The instructions and the crystal images look great, the game just doesn't work.
